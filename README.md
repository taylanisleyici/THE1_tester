# THE1_tester
To use the tester:
You need to use a Linux system, or WSL.
Make sure you put your executable file(the1.exe or you can change the name of default executable from test.py line 19) and these files in the same directory.
Run test.py.
Delete output.txt and difference.txt every time you run the tester.

Good luck...
